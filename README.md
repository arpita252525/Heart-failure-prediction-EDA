# 🩺 Heart Failure Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a heart failure prediction dataset. The goal is to analyze patient health records to identify significant factors contributing to heart disease and understand patterns within the data.

## 🧠 Objective
To explore, visualize, and derive meaningful insights from heart failure data that can help improve prediction and prevention strategies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
2. **Statistical Summary**
3. **Correlation Analysis**
4. **Data Visualization**
5. **Insights and Observations**

## 📈 Insights
- Age, ejection fraction, and serum creatinine levels are major indicators of heart failure.
- Certain combinations of medical parameters show strong correlation with survival outcomes.
